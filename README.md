# Bring_Me_The_HoriSEOn
Week 1 Assignment - CSS and HTML

For our first assignment our cohort was tasked with modifying an existing page, ensuring full functionality, and most importantly to
bring the page up to accessibility standards (semantic text, logical flow, etc.).

Small stylistic changes were made to the color of the "Horiseon" banner coloring.

Anchor to "Search Engine Optimization" fixed.

Minor adjustments made to "Made with ❤️️" footnote sizing.
